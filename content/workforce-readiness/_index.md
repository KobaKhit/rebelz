## **Workforce Readiness Services**

At the Philadelphia Rebelz Basketball Program, we recognize that true community empowerment goes far beyond the athletic court. Our commitment to holistic development extends to providing practical tools and connections that prepare youth and community members for long-term employment and economic independence. As part of our expanding Community Wellness framework, we are proud to introduce a two-track **Workforce Readiness Services Hub**, designed to serve individuals across various life stages and career paths.

### **Track 1: Soft Skills and Career Entry Services**

The first track of our Workforce Readiness initiative centers on **professional soft skills development and job preparation**, with a particular focus on youth ages 14 and up, returning citizens, and individuals facing employment barriers.

Participants will receive access to:

* **Resume & Cover Letter Development:** Personalized writing workshops and one-on-one resume review sessions


* **Mock Interviews:** Interactive simulations with feedback and coaching from real professionals


* **Job Search Navigation:** Guided access to job boards, public employment resources, and curated job fairs


* **Certification Exploration:** Assistance in locating and applying for affordable or subsidized training programs in high-demand fields such as food safety, childcare, security, and IT fundamentals



Our goal is to reduce employment friction by giving individuals the tools, language, and confidence to succeed in today’s competitive workforce.

### **Track 2: Trade School & Direct Job Placement Pathway**

The second track is focused on **technical trades and immediate employment opportunities**. Rebelz will function as a **navigation hub**—linking participants with certified trade programs and helping them move through the pipeline from interest to occupation.

Areas of focus include:

* **Electrician & Wiring Training Programs**


* **HVAC, Plumbing, and Welding School Connections**


* **Mechanic and Automotive Certification Resources**


* **Construction & Union Apprenticeship Navigation**


* **Job Matching & Interview Referral Services**



By establishing partnerships with local unions, trade schools, and apprenticeship programs, Rebelz aims to become a **launchpad for sustainable careers** in skilled labor—particularly for those who prefer hands-on, non-college routes to employment.

### **Our Vision**

The Rebelz Workforce Readiness Services are rooted in our broader mission: to **create self-sufficient, confident individuals** who can build purposeful lives, support their families, and contribute positively to their communities. This initiative not only enhances our athletic program but makes Rebelz a vital resource for lifelong growth and opportunity.
