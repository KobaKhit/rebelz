## What You'll Learn

* **AI Development Tools**: Master popular AI-assisted coding platforms like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude
* **Mobile App Development**: Build native iOS and Android applications with AI assistance
* **Web Development**: Create responsive web applications using modern frameworks
* **Machine Learning Integration**: Implement AI features into your applications
* **UI/UX Design**: Design intuitive user interfaces with AI-powered design tools
* **Project Management**: Learn agile development methodologies and version control


**App Creation Lab – Build Your Own App**

The App Creation Lab introduces participants to the fundamentals of coding logic, design thinking, and ethical technology use. Each student will develop their **own individual app concept**, working from idea to execution with mentorship from engineers, designers, and youth educators.
 Using tools like FlutterFlow, MIT App Inventor, or Replit’s mobile frameworks, participants will:

* Identify a real-world problem or passion project


* Design the user interface and layout


* Build and test their own working app
   Examples may include:


* A **basketball stat-tracking app** personalized to their team


* A **teen-focused budgeting and allowance manager**


* A **local community volunteer tracker or peer mental health support tool**



This program is about more than just coding—it’s about **ownership of innovation**, giving participants the confidence and skills to build solutions for their lives and neighborhoods.

Together, these three pillars—**Chess**, **Drones**, and **App Creation**—form the strategic, exploratory, and innovative foundation of STEM Avenue. It is a bold step toward making the Rebelz Program not only a hub for elite athletes, but a **launchpad for tomorrow’s thinkers, creators, and community builders.**
